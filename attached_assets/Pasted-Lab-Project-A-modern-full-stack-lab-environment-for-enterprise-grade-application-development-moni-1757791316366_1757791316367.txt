🆕 2025 Upgrades & Advanced Features
Frontend (WeatherTech)
Multi-city dashboard: Add, remove, and view weather for multiple favorite cities in a responsive grid.
Unit switching: Instantly toggle Celsius/Fahrenheit, km/h/mph, etc. (Settings menu).
Weather radar overlays: Precipitation, clouds, etc. with animated radar and layer toggles.
Advanced analytics: Precipitation, wind, UV, and date range selection for analytics.
Personalization: Theme and accent color picker, preferences saved locally.
Weather news feed: Articles and tips, with unread indicators and category filters.
Accessibility: Voice search, high-contrast mode, screen reader support.
User accounts & sync: (Optional) Sign in, sync preferences and favorites to the cloud.
Modern UI: Glassmorphism, smooth animations, dark/light mode, and fully responsive design.
Monitoring & Observability
MySQL Exporter: Securely exposes MySQL metrics for Prometheus using a .my.cnf file and a dedicated exporter user.
Prometheus: Now scrapes MySQL metrics via mysqld-exporter (/metrics on port 9104).
Grafana: Ready for MySQL dashboards and advanced analytics.
Docker & DevOps
High-end, multi-stage Dockerfile for frontend with security, performance, and best practices.
Custom Nginx config for SPA routing, security headers, and caching.

🌐 Accessing Applications
Service	Docker Compose	Kubernetes	Azure (Terraform)
Backend	http://localhost:3000	http://backend.local	terraform output backend
Frontend	http://localhost:5173	http://frontend.local	terraform output frontend
Prometheus	http://localhost:9090	http://prometheus.local	terraform output prometheus
Grafana	http://localhost:3001	http://grafana.local	terraform output grafana
MySQL	localhost:3306	mysql service (K8s)	terraform output mysql
For K8s, add hostnames to /etc/hosts or configure DNS.

🛠️ Troubleshooting
Backend can't connect to MySQL:
Check MySQL is running, env vars, network
CronJob not running:
Check status/logs: ./k8s/manage-cronjob.sh status|logs
Persistent Volume issues (K8s):
Check PVC status: kubectl get pvc -n lab-project
Useful K8s Commands:
kubectl get all -n lab-project
kubectl logs -f <pod> -n lab-project
kubectl describe <resource> <name> -n lab-project
kubectl port-forward svc/backend 8080:80 -n lab-project
🧹 Cleanup
Docker Compose: ./scripts/stop.sh docker
Kubernetes: cd k8s && ./delete-all.sh
Azure: cd terraform && terraform destroy
